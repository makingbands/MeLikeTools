# "Diamond Does It" Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

I Pledge allegience to the quality standards inherant in the code base provided.
There is no way to hold anyone accountable for maintaining quality beyond that.
I pledge allegience to the code formatting best practices set forth by Douglas 
Crockford at least in as far as I comprehend the purpose of those practices. I 
accept that using a jslint plugin in my IDE is neccessary and indispencable from
quality code.   I pledge allegience to the future and give my word bound by my 
honor that I will  make the best of my present including all contributions made
to this project so the future may realize its full potential.  

## Our Standards

The Standard response for behavior found to be repugnant according to "Our Pledge"
is rejection of commits and potentially, but not promised, comments explaining the 
changes that would make the code acceptable.  The standard process is technically
to use a "New Branch, Merge-into-default, Feature Release" model for Git contributions.

becomes neccessary.
