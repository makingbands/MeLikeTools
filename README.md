I made this for fun also to create NFT artwork.  You are welcome to comment and make suggestions. 
If you use the artwork in anyway please consider sending me an e-mail and making some contribution
either a new layer or sending me an $5 Amazon gift card.

If you are interested in using the art for anything commercial please contact me and do not steal my 
work.  This includes the color pallets created by the code which is not free to use and is protected 
Intellectual Property.

If you want to use the art for a single installment as part of an interior design, gift, or personal 
collection I will exchange full rights to a composition in for an a different composition of the same 
dimensions created by the same process on the same medium.
